			<h2>Soil Requirements</h2>
			<p>Tomatoes prefer well-draining soil with a pH level between 6.0 and 7.0. Cucumbers also prefer well-draining soil, but can tolerate a wider pH range of 5.5 to 7.5. Both crops require fertile soil with adequate levels of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium.</p>
		</section>
		<section id="planting-information">
			<h2>Planting Information</h2>
			<p>Tomatoes should be planted in the spring after the danger of frost has passed. Cucumbers can be planted earlier in the spring, as they can tolerate cooler temperatures. Both crops require full sun and regular watering.</p>
		</section>
		<section id="pest-and-disease-management">
			<h2>Pest and Disease Management</h2>
			<p>Tomatoes are susceptible to pests such as aphids, whiteflies, and tomato hornworms, as well as diseases such as early blight and blossom end rot. Cucumbers are susceptible to pests such as cucumber beetles, spider mites, and aphids, as well as diseases such as powdery mildew and bacterial wilt. Both crops can be managed using organic or chemical methods, depending on the preference of the grower.</p>
		</section>
		<section id="harvesting-and-storage">
			<h2>Harvesting and Storage</h2>
			<p>Tomatoes are typically harvested when they are fully ripe, which can take between 60 and 100 days after planting. Cucumbers should be harvested when they are firm and dark green, which usually takes between 50 and 70 days after planting. Both crops should be stored in a cool, dry place to prevent spoilage.</p>
		</section>
		<section id="culinary-uses">
			<h2>Culinary Uses</h2>
			<p>Tomatoes are used in a wide variety of dishes, including salads, sandwiches, sauces, and soups. Cucumbers are commonly used in salads, but can also be pickled or used in sandwiches and other dishes.</p>
